# HW5: Documentation and Style

Revise your homework 4 to make it PEP8 compliant. Begin by copying your HW4 files into this directory (the `knn` and `tests` directories) and then add docstrings and make the code PEP8 compliant with `pylint`.  The grading rubric is:
- (2 pt) Module-level documentation for both `knn.py` and `test_knn.py`
- (2 pt) Function-level and class-level documentation for both `knn.py` and `test_knn.py`, that includes descriptions of arguments, return values, and exceptions for `knn.py`. You do not need to comment on arguments or return values for `test_knn.py`, but you do need to comment about what each test validates.
- (4 pt) pylint score of 10/10 for both `knn.py` and `test_knn.py`.
- (1 pt) Include the output from pylint in a file named `pylint.md`, and also include which pylint version you used (you can find this out with `pylint --version`). If you disagree with the linter, you may disable a specific linter recommendation for a line. Include any of these deviations in `pylint.md`, along with the reasoning.
